# Language-Tokenizer
This is a Python-based GUI application that tokenizes source code input using a simple regular expression-based tokenizer. The application is built with the tkinter library, providing a user-friendly interface for users to input source code, select a programming language (currently supports Python and Urdu), and convert it into tokens.
