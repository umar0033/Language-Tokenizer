# Language-Tokenizer
This is a Python-based GUI application that tokenizes source code input using a simple regular expression-based tokenizer. The application is built with the tkinter library, providing a user-friendly interface for users to input source code, select a programming language (currently supports Python and Urdu), and convert it into tokens.

# How to Use
1. Enter the source code into the text area.
2. Select the programming language from the dropdown menu.
3. Click on "Tokenize" to process the input and display the tokenized output.
4. Click "Clear" to reset the interface for new input.
